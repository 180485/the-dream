# php-Currency Converter :money_with_wings:
A simple currency converter I made for calculate converter to check how many Euro that way-too-expensive in my holiday,but this is only for few country  and I choose EURO to convert  with IDR (indonesian Rupiah ), USD, AUD and BATH (Thai bath). and this exercise is still very simple i do it without API yet.

# Must-have features

- Pick your next travel destination and check the exchange rate: local currency / Euros.
- Make a small webpage where you can enter the local rate (use a form) and it'll tell you the price in Euros.
- Use a form that submits to PHP (no JS allowed / no preventDefault)

# Tools:wrench:
- Visual Studio Code
- XAMPP

# Result!

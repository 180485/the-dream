# php-Currency Converter :money_with_wings:
we need to build calculate converter to check how many Euros that way-too-expensive for our holiday,:smiley:

# Must-have features

- Pick your next travel destination and check the exchange rate: local currency / Euros.
- Make a small webpage where you can enter the local rate (use a form) and it'll tell you the price in Euros.
- Use a form that submits to PHP (no JS allowed / no preventDefault)
